I was able to find some time to tinker with this site, and a few project ideas I have. Most of the initial project idea's are _me too_ projects. But I think they'll be much needed experience builders for me.

1. **Garage door controller**  
    There are a lot of these around on the internet but my plan is for it to be powered by Alexa, have a web interface, and also have some sort of timeout so my door closes automatically if I forget to shut it.

1. **Medocino motor**  
    [These things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendocino_motor) are just cool as hell. I've heard they're really hard to get working, so its possible this project will never finish.

1. **Bathroom stall notifier**  
    The place I work has one stall and about 23 people using it. It's not pretty. So, it would be nice if there was a website that was updated with the status of the one and only pooper. Then I wouldn't have to get up from my desk only to suffer rejection after rejection.

That's what I'm thinking for now. I have parts on order for all of this stuff, so the posts should be rolling in soon.

I've also made a few tweaks to the site layout. Again, these early posts are more for just testing out my site layouts. On the off chance anyone is read this, thanks.
