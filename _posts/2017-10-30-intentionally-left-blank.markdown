I've created this [github account](http://github.com/0xc0ded) as a place to store my hardware hacking projects. I'm a complete n00b when it comes to hardware, so don't look here for best practices. This will mostly be the type of stuff held together with duct tape, bubble gum and very likely to burn your house down.

As of right now, I'm struggling to get this [jekyll template](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) to render the way I want for this blog. I've used [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before, but that was a long time ago, before it was so _full featured_. This post is mainly just a test to see how my templates are rendering.

I still need to get the categories and tags to link to something useful.
